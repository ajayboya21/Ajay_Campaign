        "Conclusion:\n",
        "In this project, we successfully demonstrated how to integrate SQL with Python to perform a basic sales analysis using a simple SQLite database. We began by creating a small dataset representing product sales, stored it in a SQLite table, and used SQL queries to calculate total quantities sold and revenue for each product.\n",
        "\n",
        "The summarized data was then loaded into a pandas DataFrame, allowing for easy inspection and further analysis. Finally, we visualized the total revenue per product using a bar chart created with matplotlib, offering a clear and intuitive view of sales performance.\n",

        "This project highlights how Python and SQL can be combined to:\n",
        "Efficiently manage and query small datasets,\n",

        "Produce meaningful visual insights from structured data.\n",
